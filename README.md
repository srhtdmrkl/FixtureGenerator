Write a class that generates a random football match fixture for the teams entered.

Rules :

The football league is organized on a double round-robin basis, in which every team plays all others in its league once at home and once away.

The left side of the list shows the home team and the right side the away team.

If an odd number of teams are entered, an additional team named "Bay" must be added to complete the even number. Teams matched with "Bay" means that they will not play that week.
